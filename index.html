    <!--CSS Layout -The position Property
    
    The position property specifies the type of positioning method used
    for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).

    -->

    <!--The position property
    
        The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an
        element

        There are five different position values:

        .static
        .relative
        .fixed
        .absolute
        .sticky

        Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right
        properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position
        property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position
        value.
    -->

    <!--position: static
    Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.
        HTML elements are postioned static by defualt.

        Static postioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and
        right properties.

        An element with position: static; is not positioned in any specical way;
        it is always positoned according to the normal flow of the page:

        This <div> element has position: static;

        Here is the CSS taht is used:

    -->

<h2>position: static;</h2>

<p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</p>

<div class="static">
This div element has position: static;
</div>

<hr>

<!--position: relative;

  An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

    Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned 
    element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other 
    content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

    This <div> element has position: relative;
    Here is the CSS that is used:  
-->

<h2>position: relative;</h2>

<p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>

<div class="relative">
This div element has position: relative;
</div>

<hr>

<!--position: fixed;

    An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, 
    which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. 
    The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

    A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally 
    have been located.

    Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the 
    CSS that is used:
-->

<h2>position: fixed;</h2>

<p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled:</p>

<div class="fixed">
This div element has position: fixed;
</div>

<hr>

<!--position: absolute;

    An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the 
    nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport,
    like fixed).

    However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it 
    uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

    Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and 
    can overlap elements.
-->

<h2>position: absolute;</h2>

<p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>

<div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;
  <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
</div>

<hr>

<!--position: sticky;

    An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's
    scroll position.

A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the 
scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in 
the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).

Note: you must specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for 
sticky positioning to work.

in this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0),
when you reach its scroll postion.
-->

<p>Try to <b>scroll</b> inside this frame to understand how sticky positioning works.</p>

<div class="sticky">I am sticky!</div>

<div style="padding-bottom:2000px">
  <p>In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0), when you reach its scroll position.</p>
  <p>Scroll back up to remove the stickyness.</p>
